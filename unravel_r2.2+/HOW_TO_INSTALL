               Unravel is  a  prototype  program  slicer  for  ANSI  C
          developed  at  the National Institute of Standards and Tech-
          nology (NIST).  Unravel is  usually  easy  to  install  but,
          there are some rough edges that can bite.  This file identi-
          fies the supporting software that you need, gives some hints
          for  finding  it  on  your system or the Internet, and gives
          instructions for running make.

               Unravel is written for the UNIX (or POSIX) environment.
          Unravel  needs  to  be  able to run several common UNIX com-
          mands, including: csh, sed, echo, date, yacc, and lex.   The
          echo command should allow the -n option (to indicate no new-
          line).  The original unravel development was under SunOs 4.1
          but,  we  have  compiled under Solaris, ULTRIX, SGI/IRIX and
          DEC OSF/1.

               The unravel interface was developed under X Window Sys-
          tem  X11R5  using the Xt toolkit and the MIT Athena widgets.
          Unravel should compile and run under X11R6; it also compiles
          and runs under X11R4.

               Unravel needs a C preprocessor (that  is  ANSI  C  com-
          plient  if unravel is to be used on ANSI C source code) from
          a C compiler to invoke when unravel  is  looking  at  source
          code.   Unravel compiles under either a K&R C compiler or an
          ANSI C compiler.  The gcc compiler is ANSI  complient,  pro-
          duced by the Free Software Foundation (the GNU project), and
          can be obtained over the WWW from
              http://www.yahoo.com/Computers/Software/Gnu_Software
          or by ftp to
                                prep.ai.mit.edu
          in subdirectory pub/gnu/.

               Before making unravel, the following should be done:

              Obtain unravel source via ftp from hissa.ncsl.nist.gov
              uncompress and un-tar the source code somewhere on your system
              Locate the X Window System tree with includes and libs
              Decide on a C compiler for installing unravel
              Decide on a home for installing unravel

               The    unravel    source    code    is    located    on
          hissa.ncsl.nist.gov  at  the National Institute of Standards
          and Technology.  Use ftp with  a  user  name  of  _a_n_o_n_y_m_o_u_s.
          Please  use  your _u_s_e_r _n_a_m_e  followed by an _a_t _s_i_g_n as pass-
          word (e.g., jimmy@).   This  directory  also  contains  both
          volumes  of  _N_I_S_T_I_R  _5_6_9_1  _U_n_r_a_v_e_l:  _A  _C_A_S_E  _T_o_o_l _t_o _A_s_s_i_s_t
          _E_v_a_l_u_a_t_i_o_n _o_f _H_i_g_h _I_n_t_e_g_r_i_t_y _S_o_f_t_w_a_r_e.  Volume  1  describes
          the software design of unravel and volume 2 is a user manual
          for unravel.

               The location (directory) where the unravel source  code
          is  unpacked and compiled should be selected carefully since
          once the programs are compiled, they cannot be moved without
          compiling again.

               The files have been collected into one file by tar  and
          then compressed by compress.

               If you don't know where your X Window  System  tree  is
          you  can either ask your system administrator or try the csh
          script find_software (in the unravel source directory).

               The X Window System tree  usually  has  subdirectories:
          bin,  man,  include  and  lib.  Sometimes the X includes are
          part of /usr/include and /usr/lib, but usually the MIT  dis-
          tribution of X is installed in /usr/local.

               After the X Window System tree is located the  environ-
          ment  variable  WINHOME  must be set before make can be run.
          This environment variable only needs to be  set  during  the
          make, not needed after unravel has been compiled.  For exam-
          ple, on Sun systems, the default location  of  the  tree  is
          sometimes /usr/openwin.
                          setenv WINHOME /usr/openwin

          _3._4.  _C _C_o_m_p_i_l_e_r

               The C compiler needs to  be  set  in  two  places,  the
          makefile and the file config.h.

               In the makefile, look for the compiler definition line:
                                 CC = something
          _s_o_m_e_t_h_i_n_g should be changed to either gcc (if you  have  the
          GNU  C  compiler)  or  cc (to use the compiler provided with
          your system).




          @(#)how.nr 1.5             - 2 -          August 23, 1995










               Unravel needs a C preprocessor  to  help  parse  source
          program  files.  The makefile invokes a csh script, find_cc,
          to locate a C compiler that  can  be  invoked  (via  the  -E
          option) to run just the C preprocessor.  The script searches
          the directories in the path variable  for  either  acc  (Sun
          ANSI  C compiler), gcc or cc.  If the script fails to find a
          C compiler or if you want to use a compiler  different  from
          the one found, then the file config.h must be changed.  Set-
          ting the C compiler in config.h is  a  little  tricky.   The
          file  config.h  is  generated by rules in the makefile so if
          you try to edit the file at the wrong time things might  not
          work.   The  config.h  file  must be created by running make
          before config.h can be edited.  The best method is to  check
          the config.h after make finishes.  Then to change the C com-
          piler, edit config.h and run make again.

               Once the make finishes, the  unravel  files  cannot  be
          moved  since  the  location  (directory)  where  the unravel
          source code is located is compiled into the unravel programs
          so  that  they  can find certain files (e.g., icons and help
          files).  However, the main control program can be  installed
          anywhere  in the file directory tree.  The install directory
          is  selected  by  setting  the  INSTALL_DIR  macro  in   the
          makefile.   To  set the INSTALL_DIR macro, edit the makefile
          and find the line: INSTALL_DIR = .
          Replace the dot with the selected  install  directory  name.
          For example, to install in /usr/local, change the line to:
                            INSTALL_DIR = /usr/local
          This puts the main control program (called unravel)  in  the
          directory  /usr/local/bin  and  adds  an unravel man page to
          /usr/local/man/man1.  Note that the  bin  and  man/man1  are
          added automatically to the INSTALL_DIR directory name.

               After WINHOME is set in the environment and CC  is  set
          in the makefile, type: make
          This should compile each unravel source program.   Depending
          on  the  compiler used and how it is installed, there may be
          lots of warning messages (especially if using an ANSI C com-
          piler).

               If everything has compiled correctly,  unravel  can  be
          tried  out on the simple programs in the directory examples.
          The file flavors.c has several obvious slices  and  makes  a
          good trial run.

               To run the install script, type: make install
          This copies the unravel program file and  man  page  to  the
          install subdirectories.
